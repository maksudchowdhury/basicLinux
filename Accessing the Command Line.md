<h2 align=center> Accessing the Command Line Using the Local Console </h2>
<br>

1. **Introduction**: The local console is a direct way to interact with your Linux system.
2. **Steps**:
   - **Boot your system** and wait for the login prompt.
   - **Enter your username** and press Enter.
   - **Enter your password** and press Enter.
   - You should now see a command prompt, indicating you are in the command line interface (CLI).

### Practice: Local Console Access Terms
- **Terminal**: A text-based interface to the system.
- **Shell**: The command-line interpreter that processes commands.
- **TTY**: Teletypewriter, a terminal device.
- **Login Prompt**: The screen where you enter your username and password.

### Accessing the Command Line Using the Desktop
1. **Introduction**: You can access the command line from a graphical desktop environment.
2. **Steps**:
   - **Log in to your desktop environment** (e.g., GNOME, KDE).
   - **Open a terminal emulator** (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole) from the applications menu or by pressing a keyboard shortcut (usually `Ctrl+Alt+T`).

### Practice: The GNOME 3 Desktop Environment
- **Activities Overview**: Accessed by clicking "Activities" in the top-left corner or pressing the `Super` key.
- **Applications Menu**: Where you can find and launch applications.
- **Terminal Emulator**: A program that emulates a terminal within the desktop environment.

### Executing Commands Using the Bash Shell
1. **Introduction**: Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default shell on many Linux distributions.
2. **Basic Commands**:
   - `ls`: List directory contents.
   - `cd`: Change the current directory.
   - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
   - `cp`: Copy files or directories.
   - `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
   - `rm`: Remove files or directories.
   - `man`: Display the manual for a command.

### Practice: Bash Commands and Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Commands**:
   - `ls -l`: List directory contents in long format.
   - `cd ..`: Move up one directory level.
   - `mkdir <directory>`: Create a new directory.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Ctrl+C`: Cancel the current command.
   - `Ctrl+R`: Search command history.
   - `Tab`: Auto-complete commands and filenames.

### Lab: Accessing the Command Line
1. **Objective**: Practice accessing the command line using both the local console and the desktop environment.
2. **Tasks**:
   - **Local Console**: Boot your system, log in, and execute basic commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`).
   - **Desktop Environment**: Log in to your desktop, open a terminal emulator, and execute the same basic commands.
